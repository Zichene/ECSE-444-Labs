# ECSE 444 Labs

This repo contains most of the lab code for the class ECSE 444 : Microprocessors at McGill University.
Taken during F-2023.

## Current Info (READ THIS QIHAO)
- Currently working on Part 2 of Lab
- Changing frequency seems to work dynamically (I tested it)
- Maybe we can test to see if the frequencies are actually near their supposed values?
